                        <p class="text-center line-height-lg-8">"Izakaya" is a type of Japanese pub in which a variety of small, typically inexpensive, dishes and snacks are served. It is often referred to as Japanese tapas to exemplify and celebrate the art of fusion food. The concept was introduced to explore a variety of food pairings and fusions that highlighted Japanese street food and ingredients along with twists from global food culture. Izakaya was established in 2018, as a concern of Bangladeshi conglomerate, Dekko Isho Group.</p>
